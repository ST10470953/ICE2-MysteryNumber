## Project Overview

The **[Guess Number App]** is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in the [HAW5112] subject. This application was created using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**. The app's primary purpose is to [briefly describe the purpose of the app, e.g., to be able to guess the number of the app]
The app was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment, which includes creating a functional mobile app and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.

## Purpose and Features

### Purpose:
The main goal of this app is to {to guess the correct number of the app]. 

### Key Features:
- Feature 1: [Description of a feature, e.g., "User login functionality"]
- Feature 2: [Description of another feature, e.g., "Simplicity in being able to use "]
- Feature 3: [Optional, another feature, e.g., "gives hints to find the number"]

These features aim to provide [what the app aims to achieve, e.g., an easy-to-use platform for guessing ].

## Design Considerations

The design of the **[Guess Number app ]** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience (UX)**: The app was designed with the goal of providing an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.
   
2. **Responsiveness**: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility.
   
3. **Simplicity**: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.
   
4. **Performance**: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and multiple chances.

## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated **tests** to ensure the appâ€™s functionality.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: [Briefly describe a challenge you faced, e.g., "trying to code the app ."]
   - **Solution**: [How you solved the challenge, e.g., "I had to go back to o;d apps to see if i had put it in the wrong file which turned out I had ."]
   
2. **Challenge 2**: [Describe another challenge, e.g., "Trying to put my code on github."]
   - **Solution**: [I tried different ways to put it on github and succeded by having to redo it multiple times.]

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.

## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:

1. **Feature 1**: [Description, e.g., "Allowing users to be able to ask for specifics when it says too high or too low."]
2. **Feature 2**: [Description, e.g., "Having a special celebration if they guess the number like confetti flying out of the screen."]
3. **Feature 3**: [Description, e.g., "Adding a dark mode option for better user experience."]

## Disclosure of AI Usage in My Assessment

In the development of this project, I have used generative AI tools to assist in various parts of the assignment. Below is a detailed disclosure of where and how these tools were used:

### 1. - **the number part**: Assisted in creating code snippets for setting up GitHub Actions workflows.
- **Part 3**: Used AI to help improve the grammar and clarity of the report.

### 2. **Name of AI Tool(s) Used:**

- **GitHub Copilot** (GitHub)

### 3. **Purpose/Intention Behind Use:**
- **Meaning Making**: Used AI to clarify some concepts and gain a better understanding of how certain technologies (e.g., GitHub Actions) work.
- **Initial Investigation**: Utilized AI to conduct research on best practices for Android app development and GitHub Actions setup.
- **Code Assistance**: GitHub Copilot was used to assist in writing specific parts of the code, such as setting up GitHub Actions and working with Gradle.

### 4. **Date(s) in Which Generative AI Was Used:**
- - **Part 5**: AI used on **01 August, 2025** to help set up GitHub Actions.
- **Part 3**: AI used on **05 August, 2025** for reviewing the final report.
